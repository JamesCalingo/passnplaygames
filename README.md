# Pass and Play

A "new" way to play some classic party games with friends.

# Mafia

The classic social deduction/lying to people game, mafia sees an informed minority try to eliminate the (mostly) uninformed majority before they're found.

This version has support for up to 5 mafia players, plus 4 special roles: Detective, Medic, Cupid, and Tanner. Descriptions for all of these can be found in the game and the rest of the full rules are available [here](./mafia/mafiaRules.html).

# A fake artist goes to New York

A game that takes the social deduction genre and adds an artsy twist to it, Fake Artist sees a group of people trying to collaborate on a work of art based on a word and category - except one of them doesn't know what the word is and is trying to blend in.

The full rules are available [here](./fakeart/fakeartRules.html).

# Limitations

There really shouldn't be too many.

The only problem would be if someone in the game forgets their role and messes the whole game up.
