    <p>One of the most popular social deduction games of all time, there are many different ways to play <b>Mafia</b>. Here is just one possible ruleset.</p>

    <p>One player will be the moderator for the round. They are a neutral party responsible for making sure the game runs smoothly during the night phase and facilitating discussion without involving themselves during the day phase. This person should be the one to input the number of players, how many mafia there are, and if there are any special roles into the device this app is running on (though this is not necessary). Once everything has been inputted into the app, the device running the app should be passed around to the rest of the players one by one.</p>

    <p>A screen will come up instructing each player to click a button, after which they will see a screen with their role in the game, as well as an explanation of their role. There will also be a button to move back to the original page, so that players can pass the device around without knowing anyone else's role.</p>

    <p>Once everyone has their roles, the game can begin.</p>
