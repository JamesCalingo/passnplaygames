    <p>This is an interesting take on the social deduction genre, using pen and paper to try to discern who the uninformed minority is.</p>

    <p>(By the way, you will need paper (or a whiteboard) and some pens for this - preferably different colored ones. If you already own a copy of this game, this app basically replaces the little whiteboards used to distribute the word.</p>

    <p>One player will be the "leader" for the round, so to speak. That player should have whatever device this application is being run on first.</p>

    <p>They will come up with a word and a category to describe that word, then indicate how many players there are in the game. Once they've set all those up on the device, it should be passed around to the players one by one.</p>

    <p class ="appHelp">A screen will come up instructing each player to click a button, after which they will see the category and word - or, if they're chosen to be the fake artist, they will know that they are the fake. Once they know their role, they should click the button and make sure that the word is NOT on the screen, so that players can pass the device around without knowing anyone else's role.</p>

    <p>After this, players will pass around a piece of paper and draw the image on it. Generally, after each player has drawn two lines (what defines a "line" is up to the group), they will try to guess who the fake artist is, and then if they catch the fake, the fake artist have a chance to guess what the drawing is.</p>

    <p>The players win if they can catch the fake artist AND the fake artist guesses the drawing incorrectly. The fake artist (and technically the leader) wins if they are not caught, or if they can guess what the drawing was.</p>

    <p>Also, don't be that guy who griefs and just scribbles over everything...</p>
