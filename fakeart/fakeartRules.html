    <div class="jumbotron-fluid bg-dark text-light text-center display-3 py-3">How to Play <b>A fake artist goes to New York</b></div>

    <p>This is an interesting take on the social deduction genre, using pen and paper to try to discern who the uninformed minority is.</p>

    <p>(By the way, you will need paper and some pens for this - preferably different colored ones. If you already own this game, this app basically replaces the whiteboards).</p>

    <p>One player will be the "leader" for the round, so to speak. That player should have whatever device this application is being run on first.</p>

    <p>They will come up with a word and a category to describe that word, then indicate how many players there are in the game. Once they've set all those up on the device, it should be passed around to the players one by one.</p>

    <p class ="appHelp">A screen will come up instructing each player to click a button, after which they will see a screen with the category and word - or, if they're chosen to be the fake artist, they will know that they are the fake. There will also be a button to move back to the original page, so that players can pass the device around without knowing anyone else's role.</p>

    <p>After this, players will pass around a piece of paper and draw the image on it. After each player has drawn two lines (what defines a "line" is up to the group), they will try to guess who the fake artist is, and then if they catch the fake, the fake artist have a chance to guess what the drawing is.</p>

    <p>The players win if they can catch the fake artist AND the fake artist guesses the drawing incorrectly. The fake artist (and technically the leader) wins if they are not caught, or if they can guess what the drawing was.</p>

    <p class="hide">Since you found me, I'll give you an idea: try making the word "X - You are the fake artist!" exactly like that and see what chaos it causes...</p>
